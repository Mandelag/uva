Define domino card:

struct Domino {
	int left;
	int right;
};

also to help look up pair value, we index it using map.

std::map<int, []int> ;

also to help look up which card we already use, we use some set.
std::vector<bool> used;


iterate "path" left and right of the domino, to other left/right of other dominos, maximum of n.
if it ends up with the last domino piece, solution is found!
